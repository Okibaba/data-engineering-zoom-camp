I think it is important to note that the config file needs to be named 'Dockerfile' with no extension and also you need to run "docker build -t test:pandas ." from the directory where you saved this file.
docker build -t test:pandas .

docker run -it python:3.9
docker run -it --entrypoint bash python:3.9
